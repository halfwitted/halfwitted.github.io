Salvador Dalí once said, “A true artist is not
one who is inspired,but one who inspires others
” When it comes to photography though, inspira-
tion can be a tough nut to crack. 

We all know it’s sometimes difficult to stay in
touch with our creative side,especially when we
are overwhelmed by daily tasks or we feel stuck
in a repetitive routine. 

If you find that your favorite music or your 
best-loved movie director no longer stirs your 
imagination, it’s time to turn your attention
to the all-time classics: the famous photogra-
phers that shook the world.

There are few things more powerful than drawing
inspiration from people who were true pioneers
-in their field.

So let’s have a look at 10 amazing artists who shaped the world of photography with their innovative ideas and their
amazing talent!
